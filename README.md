# template-iot-android
This is a frontend, IoT, cordova application.
I used many libraries, frameworks and plugins such as Onsenui, FontAwsome, jQuery, etc...
I also included the bluetoothLE plugin so that the mobile app connects to an ESP32 board and acces it's services and characteristics.

This is currently my progress!
